Can create an Anaconda cloud account to create you own channel

Conda-forge and Bioconda
Conda-forge
    Over 21,000 packages
    multiple maintainers per package?
    Certain files that contain the package metadata

pyproject.toml
    PEP 518
    2016
    Allows setuptools to install itself during the packaging proces

Recipe
    Meta.yaml file - metadata
    build script - build.sh or build.bat
        Or will look for build script inline

When you submit a recipe to the conda-forge repo, scanned then create feedstock

Grayskull - automatically generates recipes for conda packages, github repos,
    Takes recipe to build conda package

Making a public github repository for that sake of making it available to the packaging tools

`conda info --envs` lists all of the known conda environments

Add __init__.py file to the python package, to make it a package
    Whatever the names imported into __init__ will be the 'public api' of the package
    They are available as names in top level namespace of the package

Create pytest.ini to hold pytest in the top level of the package folder
pytest is included in the conda distribution

```Conda Clear Cash```
`conda clean --all --yes` clears the system wide miniconda cache

Create setup.py file
setup() function will be called when we want to setup a package
Add metadata - name, version (a complicated subject), etc
include_package_data = True: can include addition non-Python resources in your package
packages = find(packags) can exclude packages you don't want to include
install_requires = dependencies
    Useful script `conda env export -n environmentName --no-builds > environment.yaml

In conda, the channels are in an ordered list
Packages are resolved in channel order name down this list
So in theory yes malicious packages could be installed in earlier channels in the list
Do you absolutely definitely need every pacakge?

Then go through and prune the dependencies to the ones you actually need, manually
If you install from pip, there will be a section in the dependencies  for pip dependencies
    Conda dependencies will be installed first, then from pip

Write a descrpitin into README.md
